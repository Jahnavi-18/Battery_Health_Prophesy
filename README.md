#### ABSTRACT

This project utilizes battery datasets from NASA, focusing on measured variables like Voltage, Charge, Current, Temperature, Time, and Capacity. It extracts health indices (HIâ€™s) from battery datasets, emphasizing Charge and Discharge cycles. The project involves capacity extraction, health indices extraction, and correlation analysis to predict battery State of Health (SOH).
